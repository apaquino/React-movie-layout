# React 0.14 for web apps with webpack and babel 6 basic configuration

This is a basic starter kit to build quick prototypes of apps or test new features using React for the web.
It uses React and React-Dom version 0.14 with webpack 1.x and babel 6.
I clone this repo when I feel like hacking or doing quick POC's and I want minimal setup.

You should have node/npm installed as well.

To start it assumes you have the following installed globally
```
npm install babel webpack webpack-dev-server -g
```

Then do the following:

```
npm install
```

Lastly do the following:

```
npm start
```

You should have a dev server running on port 3333.  

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3333

Update the index.html file to update the title

Start hacking by updating the /components/app.js
