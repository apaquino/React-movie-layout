## Instructions:

Review the files in the following order.  Be sure to read the entire file.
Some files have comments at the very bottom.

1. actions/reduceActions.js (normally just actions.js but at one time had flux actions)
2. reducers/movieReducer.js (note actors is identical methodology)
3. reducers/rootReducer.js
4. stores/reduxConfigureStore.js (folder should be singular but flux is plural)
5. main.js
6. container/app.js
7. components/actors.js (to show non-container can connect)
8. note: normally you want all the state to be passed down from container component

Next update: Make reducers use Immutable data structures.
