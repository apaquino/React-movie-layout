1.    setup express to handle the graphql endpoint.
2.    insert express-graphql middleware.
3.    setup schema.js in data folder (convention).
4.    in schema.js, import all types, fetch, and relevant KEYS
5.    create a query GraphQLObjectType
6.    in this case, make a movieType GraphQLObjectType
7.    fields should be what is returned by API call, all fields
8.    in the query GraphQLObjectType, create movies that returns a type GraphQLList
9.    in the resolve method, return fetch call for the API
10.   create a schema with the GraphQLSchema class (use new)
11.   the object should be the query.  use es2015 query:Query
12.   export the schema!
13.   in the express file, add schema in the middleware, use es2015
14.   highly recommended to add the graphiql key set to true
15.   in the flux API, use post method because of get character limits
16.   the success promise should return response.data.  data is the default return in graphiql
17.   call the server action with the right payload
18.   with args, you need to add args and pass to the resolve function
19.   args is an object.  it has keys and each key has a type KEYS
20.   if the object doesn't need to be passed, use the _ function in the resolve
      e.g. resolve(_, {destructure args object here})
